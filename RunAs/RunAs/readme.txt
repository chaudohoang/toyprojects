How to use:

1. Fill in credentials (can import existing credentials file or export to new credentials file).

2. Browse application to run (absolute path is needed to run) then click Run application.

3. To generate a launcher, click Generate lancher (if path is not absolute, put the launcher file to same folder with application).

4. (Optional) Check "Calculated SHA256 from target :" to generate unique launcher that use SHA256 Hash
(Use SHA256 hash to prevent file renaming abuse, launcher file will only run the specific app which match the SHA256).

5. (optional) Check "PC list filter :" to make the launcher run only with user in the list.
